You are an expert test automation architect analyzing test scenarios to identify patterns for a reusable SDK.

## Task
Analyze the provided test automation scenarios and identify common patterns that could be used to create a reusable SDK.

## Scenarios to Analyze
{{ guide_data }}

## Analysis Requirements
Please identify and document:

### 1. Common UI Interaction Patterns
- What UI elements are commonly interacted with?
- What are the typical user flows?
- Are there repeated sequences of actions?

### 2. Reusable Functions
- What functions could be extracted and reused?
- What parameters would make them flexible?
- How could they be organized by category?

### 3. Parameterization Opportunities
- What values could be parameterized?
- What would make scenarios more flexible?
- How could credentials, data, or selectors be made configurable?

### 4. Navigation Patterns
- How do scenarios typically navigate between pages?
- Are there common navigation sequences?
- What navigation helpers could be created?

### 5. Form Handling Patterns
- How are forms typically filled and submitted?
- What validation patterns exist?
- How could form operations be standardized?

### 6. Authentication & Authorization
- What authentication patterns exist?
- How are different user roles handled?
- What security patterns should be documented?

### 7. Data Management
- How is test data created and managed?
- What cleanup patterns exist?
- How could data operations be standardized?

### 8. Verification & Assertions
- What verification patterns are common?
- How are success/failure conditions checked?
- What assertion helpers could be created?

## Output Format
Provide your analysis in a clear, structured format that could be used as documentation. Focus on practical, implementable patterns rather than theoretical concepts.

## Guidelines
- Be specific about what patterns you see
- Suggest concrete function names and signatures
- Consider how patterns could be composed together
- Think about maintainability and reusability
- Don't assume patterns that aren't evident in the data
