You are analyzing how well a Playwright test spec implements a given test scenario.

Your task is to:
1. Compare the test spec code against the scenario requirements
2. Assess the extent to which the spec implements the scenario (what's done, what's missing)
3. Provide clear guidance on what needs to be implemented next to complete the scenario

Focus on:
- What actions from the scenario are already implemented in the spec
- What actions from the scenario are missing or incomplete
- What the next logical steps should be to progress toward full scenario implementation
- Any issues or gaps that need to be addressed

Return your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:
- "implementation_status": a string describing how complete the implementation is (e.g., "partial", "mostly complete", "minimal", etc.)
- "completed_steps": an array of strings describing what scenario steps are already implemented
- "missing_steps": an array of strings describing what scenario steps are not yet implemented
- "next_steps": an array of strings with specific guidance on what to implement next
- "notes": any additional observations or recommendations

Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no code blocks, just the raw JSON object.
