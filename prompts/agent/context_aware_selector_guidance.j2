Analyze this test step and provide the top 10 most relevant HTML5 selectors for Playwright automation:

Step: "{{ current_step }}"

Based on the step description, identify the most likely HTML elements that would be needed and provide exactly 10 selectors in this format:

SELECTOR_CONTEXT: [Brief context description]
1. selector1 (for element type)
2. selector2 (for element type)
3. selector3 (for element type)
...
10. selector10 (for element type)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use ONLY standard HTML5 semantic selectors
- Use ONLY attribute selectors like [name="..."], [type="..."], [role="..."]
- Use ONLY text selectors like text="..."
- NEVER use ID selectors like #anything
- NEVER use data-testid selectors like [data-testid="..."]
- NEVER invent made-up selectors
- Focus on the most common and reliable selectors for this type of step

Examples of GOOD selectors:
- input[name="username"]
- button[type="submit"]
- text="Login"
- nav
- form
- select
- textarea

Examples of BAD selectors (DO NOT USE):
- #username
- [data-testid="login"]
- #submit
- .login-button
