Convert the following test scenario into a list of concrete steps that a skilled manual QA engineer would perform. Each step should be a clear, actionable instruction.

Assumptions:
- You are starting at the system's root URL (no need to open browser or navigate to the base URL)
- When filling a form with multiple inputs, group all input fields into a single step rather than creating separate steps for each field
- Form filling should be represented as a single step that combines all field identification and value entry for that form
- Do not invent specific URLs, selectors, or implementation details. Use generic descriptions rather than specific URLs or element selectors

Return only a JSON array of strings, one step per string. Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks or any other formatting. Return only the raw JSON array.

Scenario:
