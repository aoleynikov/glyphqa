Convert the following test scenario into a condensed list of executable steps. Each step should represent a logical unit of work that can be executed atomically without page state changes between actions.

Step Condensation Principles:
1. Form operations: Fill all form fields AND submit the form in a single step. Never split form filling and submission into separate steps.
2. Page transitions: Create a new step only when navigating to a different page, section, or when the page structure meaningfully changes.
3. Related actions: Group related actions that happen on the same page/view into one step (e.g., "fill login form and submit" is one step, not "fill username", "fill password", "click submit").
4. Verifications: Include verifications/assertions in the same step as the action that produces what's being verified, when possible.
5. Bulk operations: When multiple similar actions occur (e.g., filling multiple fields), combine them into a single step.

Examples of good step condensation:
- "Fill login form with username and password, then submit" (NOT: "fill username", "fill password", "click submit")
- "Navigate to user management section" (single navigation step)
- "Create new user by filling form with name, email, role and submitting" (form fill + submit in one step)
- "Verify dashboard displays and check navigation contains Users and Settings" (verification grouped with context)

Assumptions:
- You are starting at the system's root URL (no need to open browser or navigate to the base URL)
- Do not invent specific URLs, selectors, or implementation details. Use generic descriptions.

Return only a JSON array of strings, one step per string. Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks or any other formatting. Return only the raw JSON array.
