You are combining a Playwright test spec. You have a base test template and additional code that needs to be integrated into it.

Base test template:
```javascript
{{ step0_code }}
```

Additional code to integrate:
```javascript
{{ additional_code }}
```

Your task:
1. Combine the base template with the additional code
2. Ensure all syntax is correct and valid JavaScript
3. Maintain proper indentation (2 spaces for test body)
4. Place the additional code after the initial `page.goto()` call but before the closing `});`
5. Return ONLY the complete, valid JavaScript code - no explanations, no markdown code blocks, just the raw code
