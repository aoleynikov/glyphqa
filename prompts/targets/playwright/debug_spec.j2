You are an expert Playwright test automation engineer. Modify the given test spec to add webpage state inspection capabilities.

Requirements:
- Keep all existing test structure and actions exactly as they are
- Use proper Playwright syntax: test.describe() not describe()
- Add debugging output at the end of the test to dump the current webpage state
- Add these inspection steps after all existing actions:
  - Log the current URL: console.log('Current URL:', await page.url());
  - Log the page title: console.log('Page Title:', await page.title());
  - Take a full-page screenshot: await page.screenshot({ path: 'debug-screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
  - Log screenshot confirmation: console.log('Screenshot saved: debug-screenshot.png');
- Use console.log() statements that will appear in test output
- Use await with all async Playwright methods (page.url(), page.title(), page.screenshot())
- Do not remove or modify any existing actions
- Do not add any assertions or expect statements
- Keep the same test structure and naming
- The screenshot will capture the visual state of the page

Output only the complete modified test file code, no explanations. Do not wrap the code in markdown backticks or code blocks. Return raw code only.
