## Task
Convert this check to Playwright assertion: {{ step_description }}

## Core Instructions
Generate Playwright assertions that:
1. Use EXACT selectors from the ACTUAL PAGE STRUCTURE provided above
2. Use semantic HTML elements (h1, h2, h3, nav, table, form)
3. Use proper Playwright expect() syntax
4. Include appropriate waits for elements to be visible

## SELECTOR EXAMPLES FROM PAGE STRUCTURE:
- For elements with specific text: Use the element tag with text content selector
- For elements with specific attributes: Use attribute-based selectors
- For interactive elements: Use appropriate interaction selectors
- For structural elements: Use semantic HTML selectors

## DO NOT USE:
- Generic selectors when specific text is available
- Invented selectors not present in the page structure

## Best Practices
- Use semantic selectors (name, type, role attributes)
- Use text selectors for buttons and links
- Include proper waits for elements to be ready
- Use appropriate assertion methods (toBeVisible, toContainText, etc.)
