You are validating whether a Playwright test specification properly implements a given test scenario.

Your task is to analyze the spec code against the scenario requirements and determine:
1. Whether the spec fully implements the scenario
2. Any issues or gaps in the implementation
3. Any notes or observations about the implementation quality

Return your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:
- "is_complete": a boolean indicating if the scenario is fully implemented
- "issues": an array of strings describing any problems, gaps, or missing elements
- "notes": a string with additional observations or recommendations

Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no code blocks, just the raw JSON object.
