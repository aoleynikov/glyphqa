Write the minimal list of UI actions needed to successfully complete the happy path for the described feature. 

INCLUDE ONLY:
- Click, select, navigate actions
- Form submissions with structured data
- Button presses
- Navigation to pages
- References to other scenarios using [ref: <scenario_name>] format

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Verification steps (verify, check, see, confirm, ensure)
- Observation steps (you should see, notice, observe)
- Descriptive text about what appears on screen
- Steps that describe what the user should see or notice
- Individual form field entries (group related fields together)

FORM FILLING PATTERN - GROUP RELATED FIELDS:
- Instead of separate actions for each form field, group related fields into a single "fill form" action
- Use structured key-value format: "fill {field_name: value, field_name: value} in form"
- Examples:
  - "fill {username: admin, password: admin_password} in login form"
  - "fill {name: Test User, email: test@example.com, role: user} in user creation form"
  - "fill {title: New Post, content: Post content} in post form"

IMPORTANT - USE GENERIC DESCRIPTIONS:
- Instead of "click \"Add New User\"", use "click the create user button" or "navigate to user creation"
- Instead of "click \"Submit\"", use "submit the form" or "click the submit button"
- Instead of "click \"Login\"", use "click the login button" or "submit login form"
- Use generic terms that describe the action's purpose, not specific UI text

SCENARIO REFERENCES:
When the description mentions actions that are covered by other scenarios (like "login as administrator", "create a user", etc.), reference them using the format:
[ref: <scenario_name>] <brief description>

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Never reference the current scenario you are processing
2. Only reference scenarios from the EXACT list below - use the exact scenario names provided
3. Do not invent or infer scenario names that are not in the list
4. If you need to reference a scenario but it's not in the list, just describe the action directly

For example:
[ref: login_as_admin] login as administrator user
[ref: create_user] create new user
[ref: logout] logout from the application

Available scenarios for reference (use these exact names):
{% for scenario in available_scenarios %}
- {{ scenario.name }}: {{ scenario.description }}
{% endfor %}

Write each action on a new line. Do NOT add dashes, bullet points, or numbering to the actions. Only include actions that the user actually performs.
