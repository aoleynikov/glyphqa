Write the minimal list of UI actions needed to successfully complete the happy path for the described feature. 

INCLUDE ONLY:
- Click, type, select, navigate actions
- Form submissions
- Button presses
- Navigation to pages
- References to other scenarios using [ref: <scenario_name>] format

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Verification steps (verify, check, see, confirm, ensure)
- Observation steps (you should see, notice, observe)
- Descriptive text about what appears on screen
- Steps that describe what the user should see or notice

SCENARIO REFERENCES:
When the description mentions actions that are covered by other scenarios (like "login as admin", "create a user", etc.), reference them using the format:
[ref: <scenario_name>] <brief description>

For example:
[ref: login_as_admin] login as admin user
[ref: user_management] create new user
[ref: login_as_user] login as regular user

Available scenarios for reference:
{% for scenario in available_scenarios %}
- {{ scenario.name }}: {{ scenario.description }}
{% endfor %}

Write each action on a new line. Do NOT add dashes, bullet points, or numbering to the actions. Only include actions that the user actually performs.
