Summarize this scenario into a brief, action-oriented description that explains what this scenario accomplishes.

Focus on:
- The main goal or outcome
- Key actions performed
- What the user achieves

Keep it concise (1-2 sentences max) and use action verbs.

Example formats:
- "Logs in as admin user with admin/admin_password credentials"
- "Creates a new user with specified name, email, and role"
- "Logs in as regular user and accesses user dashboard"

Write only the summary, no additional text.
