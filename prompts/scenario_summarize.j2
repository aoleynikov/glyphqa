Rephrase the scenario below into a brief, concise one-sentence summary. Use direct action verbs, not verbose phrases. This summary will be used to help other scenarios identify if they reference or depend on this scenario.

Completely ignore:
- Any verification, assertions, checks, or "should" statements
- Navigation results, redirects, or page states reached
- What the scenario verifies or confirms
- Any mention of what happens after the action (redirects, page displays, etc.)

Focus only on the core action: what it does or sets up. Be concise and direct. Do not use phrases like "this scenario" - just rephrase the action directly.

Return only the summary text. Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks or any other formatting. Return only the plain text summary.

Scenario:
{{ scenario_text }}
