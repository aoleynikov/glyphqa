Determine if scenario A is required as a dependency for scenario B.

Scenario A (potential dependency):
Name: {{ scenario_a.name }}
Text: {{ scenario_a.text }}

Scenario B (being analyzed):
Name: {{ scenario_b.name }}
Text: {{ scenario_b.text }}

Question: Is scenario A required as a dependency for scenario B to run?

Before answering, analyze both scenarios:
1. If scenario B mentions an action, check if it provides detailed steps for that action (navigation, clicking, verification, etc.)
2. If scenario B only mentions an action without detailed steps, check if scenario A provides those detailed steps
3. If scenario A provides detailed steps for an action that scenario B only mentions, then scenario A is required

A scenario A is required for scenario B if:
- Scenario B explicitly states a required starting state or condition that scenario A creates (like "you should be...", "you must be...", "assume...")
- Scenario B explicitly mentions that an action must have been completed, and scenario A performs that exact action
- Scenario B mentions performing an action, and scenario A describes how to perform that action within the system
- Scenario B mentions an action but doesn't provide detailed steps for how to perform it (like navigation, clicking, verification), and scenario A provides those detailed steps - merely mentioning an action is NOT the same as describing how to perform it
- Scenario B cannot start without the state/condition that scenario A establishes

A scenario A is NOT required for scenario B if:
- Scenario B describes performing an action itself in detail with specific steps for that action (e.g., if scenario B says "Navigate to X, click Y, verify Z" for an action, it describes how to do that action itself) - the fact that scenario B mentions an action as part of its flow does NOT automatically mean it describes how to do it, it must actually provide the detailed steps
- Scenario A and scenario B are inverse operations - one does not depend on the other
- Scenario A and scenario B are independent flows that don't reference each other

Return only a JSON object with two fields:
- "justification": a brief explanation of your decision, referencing specific parts of scenario B's text if scenario A is required, or explaining why it's not required
- "required": true or false

Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks or any other formatting. Return only the raw JSON object.
