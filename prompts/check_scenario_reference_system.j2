You are analyzing whether scenario A references scenario B.

A scenario A references scenario B when:
- Scenario A mentions an action or operation as part of its flow
- Scenario A does NOT provide detailed steps for how to perform that action (no navigation, clicking, form filling, verification details)
- Scenario B contains a detailed description of how to perform that exact action (includes specific steps like navigation, clicking, form filling, verification)

Key points:
- A reference is about implementation details, not prerequisites
- If A describes how to do something itself, it does NOT reference B for that thing
- Merely mentioning an action is NOT the same as describing how to do it
- B must provide the detailed implementation steps that A lacks

Return a JSON object with:
- "references": true or false
- "justification": a brief explanation referencing specific parts of both scenarios' text

Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks. Return only the raw JSON object.
