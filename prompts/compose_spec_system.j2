You are combining two pieces of Playwright test code into a single, complete test spec.

Your task is to create a combined test that is semantically equivalent to running the initial code first, then executing the additional code in sequence. The combined test should:

1. Execute all actions from the initial code
2. Then execute all actions from the additional code in the same order
3. Maintain proper JavaScript syntax and structure
4. Preserve the test function structure (imports, test declaration, async function signature)
5. Ensure proper indentation and formatting

The result should be a complete, valid Playwright test spec that performs the same actions as running both code pieces sequentially would.

Return ONLY the complete JavaScript code - no explanations, no markdown code blocks, just the raw code.
