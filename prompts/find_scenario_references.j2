Analyze the scenario below and identify which other scenarios it references or depends on.

Scenario being analyzed: {{ scenario.name }}

Available scenarios:
{% for name, summary in scenario_summaries.items() %}
- {{ name }}: {{ summary }}
{% endfor %}

Step 1: Read the scenario text below carefully.

Step 2: Identify ONLY explicit prerequisites - states or conditions that must already exist BEFORE this scenario can start. Look for phrases at the beginning that indicate:
- "you should be..." or "you must be..." (indicating a required starting state)
- "assume..." or "given that..." (indicating a prerequisite condition)
- Explicit statements about what needs to exist before starting

CRITICAL: Do NOT treat actions described IN the scenario as prerequisites. If the scenario text describes a sequence of actions (like "first do X, then do Y"), those are part of the scenario flow, not prerequisites. Only include dependencies if the scenario explicitly states a required starting state or condition.

Step 3: For each prerequisite you identified, check if any of the available scenarios above creates that exact state. Match the prerequisite to the scenario summary that describes creating that state.

Step 4: For each dependency you identified, create a JSON object with:
- "scenario": the scenario name (the key from the list above)
- "justification": a brief explanation referencing the specific phrase in the scenario text that indicates the prerequisite state

Important: 
- Self-referencing is not allowed.
- Only include scenarios that create a state that MUST exist before this scenario starts.
- If the scenario describes its own complete flow from beginning to end without requiring a pre-existing state, return an empty array.
- Do not infer dependencies from actions that are part of the scenario's own flow.

Return only a JSON array of objects. Each object must have "scenario" and "justification" fields. If there are no dependencies, return an empty array []. Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks or any other formatting. Return only the raw JSON array.
