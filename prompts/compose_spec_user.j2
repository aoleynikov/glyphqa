Initial code (the test spec we are modifying):

```javascript
{{ base_code }}
```

Additional code to include (execute after the initial code):

```javascript
{{ additional_code }}
```

Combine these into a single complete Playwright test spec that executes all actions from the initial code, then all actions from the additional code.
